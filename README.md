# IPOManager
This repository offers a simple management program that specializes in providing software solutions for managing Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in C programming language. 
The program features a menu-driven interface where users can interact with the system in a straightforward manner. When the user chooses to add a new IPO, the user will be prompted to input details such as the company name, stock symbol, offering price, number of shares, and underwriters. These details will be organized and stored for each IPO, and will be implemented to manage multiple IPOs.
To enhance user experience, a search and retrieve functionality allows users to look up specific IPOs by entering either the company name or stock symbol. If the system finds a match, it will display the relevant information for the IPO. Additionally, the program includes error handling mechanisms to address scenarios such as attempting to add a duplicate IPO entry or searching for a non-existent IPO. These measures aim to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the IPO data within the system.
In summary, the program offers a comprehensive solution for IPO data management, featuring user-friendly input, efficient data organization, easy retrieval options, a menu-driven interface, and robust error handling capabilities.
